# Rim Flood

A RimWorld mod by Fenndragon.

## Description
Adds The Flood from Halo to possible raiding factions for RimWorld

BEWARE the Flood are an extremely aggressive and dangerous race who can completely ruin an unprepared settlement.

If attacked by an infection form your colonists CAN BE TURNED INTO COMBAT FORMS. try not to get too close to these little buggers and for the love of god if you see flood hives on the map kill them ASAP.


Flood raids are disabled until day 45 just like mechanoids as they are to be considered a late game race.

have fun~
